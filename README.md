# Scientific-Calculator_Project
My first project using C language. In this project i built a scientific calculator that can perform various mathematical operations.  For more info visit my git hub profile using this link https://github.com/darshan45672

<h3>About the project</h3>
<p>This calculator can perform various mathematical operations with great accuracy. This project has 4 versions which are enhanced versions of previous ones. Each version has a unique special feature. detials of each versions are listed below.</p>
<ul>
  <ls>
   <h4>Version 1.0 </h4>
    <p>This the prototype model!. Here the user can perform some limited mathematical operations as per the reqiurements of the user. Check out this link to look through the codes https://github.com/darshan45672/Project-on-Scientefic-Calculator/blob/master/sci-fi_calci.c</p>
    <p>Here are some snapshots of outputs of this model.<br><img src ="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109609462/214763221-54c036e4-f6c1-416f-9e1d-3854cc9c1815.png"><br><img src ="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109609462/214763360-47ce3ab9-70c3-453d-a4cf-1e8ccbe7659e.png"><br><img src ="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109609462/214763506-a8c0271d-87b4-4ec6-b7f4-00069ec5be6f.png"><br><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109609462/214763687-c093437c-6fb9-4dbe-bf3b-f7ab82981825.png"></p>
   <h4>Version 2.0 </h4>
    <p>This is a modular version of previous program. Here the mathematical operations are segregated into arthematical, trigonometrical, Logarithmic and Exopnential operations etc. Check out this link to look through the codes https://github.com/darshan45672/Project-on-Scientefic-Calculator/blob/master/sci-fi_calci2.c</p>
    <p><b>Special feature:</b> Here user can can exit at any point and come back to previous page anytime.</p>
    <p>Here are some snapshots of outputs of this model.</p>
    <h4>Version 3.0</h4>
    <p>THis is a well organised and beautified version of version 2.0. Each section opens in a new page and user can perform arthematical, trigonometrical, Logarithmic and Exopnential operations etc. Check out this link to look through the codes https://github.com/darshan45672/Project-on-Scientefic-Calculator/blob/master/sci-fi_calci3.c</p>
    <p><b>Special feature:</b> Each category opens in a new page. Trignometric operations are categorised into degree mode and radian mode, where user can choose which-ever mode he prefers.  Here user can can exit at any point and come back to previous page anytime.</p>
    <p>Here are some snapshots of outputs of this model.</p></p>
  </ls>  
</ul>
<h4><b>Upcoming version</b> : Version 4.0</h4>
<p>expected features : section where you can perform algebraic operstions like finding roots for quadriatic and cubic equation</p>
<h1>Stay tuned!!!!!!!!</h1>
