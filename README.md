# Scientific-Calculator_Project
My first project using C language. In this project i built a scientific calculator that can perform various mathematical operations.  For more info visit my git hub profile using this link https://github.com/darshan45672

<h3>About the project</h3>
<p>This calculator can perform various mathematical operations with great accuracy. This project has 4 versions which are enhanced versions of previous ones. Each version has a unique special feature. detials of each versions are listed below.</p>
<ul>
  <ls>
   <h4>Version 1.0 </h4>
    <p>This the prototype model!. Here the user can perform some limited mathematical operations as per the reqiurements of the user. Check out this link to look through the codes https://github.com/darshan45672/Project-on-Scientefic-Calculator/blob/master/sci-fi_calci.c</p>
    <p>Here are some snapshots of outputs of this model.</p>
